//How to implement relationships
//One to many (an article can have one author)
//Many to many (one author can have tons of articles)

//in our table, you have an author with an id, and then each article would have that author's id within it to link the author to the article

//foreign key is a key that links two tables together(the author would be the foreign key in this example)
//the table containing the foreign key is the child, and the primary key is the parent table
